    <p>Nexus only works on certain supported <strong>LINUX/UNIX</strong> distros</p>
    <p>it will not function or work on Microsoft Windows or Apple Mac OSX.</p>
    <p>Nexus supports:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Debian/Debian based distros</li>
      <li>Arch/Arch based distros</li>
      <li>FreeBSD</li>

    </ol>
    <p>if your OS is either based or the following listed above you will be met with a error upon the Nexus package build stage</p>

    <summary><span style="color: royalblue;"><u>Package's not found</u></span></summary>
    <p>if Nexus is unable to find the packages on your system rerun the program</p>
    <p>during the setup phase nexus installs the packages but will still give a error stating the packages are not found</p>
    <p>rerunning the program should work because the formerly missing packages will be installed a ready to be used</p>
    <p>if your package manager for some reason cannot find the packages in it's repo's</p>
    <p>then please find other means to add repo's that do carry the required packages too your package manager</p>
    <p>if for some reason you are unable to add repo's that can be read and used by your packaage manager</p>
    <p>then please build the required packages from scratch</p>
