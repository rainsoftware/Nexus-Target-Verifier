    <p>Nexus only works on certain supported <strong>LINUX/UNIX</strong> distros</p>

      <li>Arch/Arch based distros</li>
      <li>FreeBSD</li>

    <summary><span style="color: royalblue;"><u>Package's not found</u></span></summary>
    <p>if Nexus is unable to find the packages on your system rerun the program</p>
    <p>during the setup phase nexus installs the packages but will still give a error stating the packages are not found</p>
    <p>rerunning the program should work because the formerly missing packages will be installed a ready to be used</p>
    <p>if your package manager for some reason cannot find the packages in it's repo's</p>
    <p>then please find other means to add repo's that do carry the required packages too your package manager</p>
    <p>if for some reason you are unable to add repo's that can be read and used by your packaage manager</p>
    <p>then please build the required packages from scratch</p>
    <h6>required package list</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Lua</li>
      <li>Cmake</li>
      <li>Python</li>

    <summary><span style="color: royalblue;"><u>Cmake install error "Nebulae"</u></span></summary>
    <p>Cmake error nebulae is a error that occurs when your cmake package is either corrupted or missing essential files to work</p>
    <p>to fix the error please first attempt to reinstall cmake via your package manager</p>
    <p>if your using apt or dpkg on debian based systems attempt to fix broken or missing packages</p>
    <p>if this method of fixing error code nebulae fails please make a github issue for further support</p>

  <details>
    <summary><span style="color: royalblue;"><u>Lua version error</u></span></summary>
    <p>Lua is more of a backup package and does not quite serve a purpose yet</p>
    <p>if you encounter a error that mentions conflicts with the lua package then please uninstall Lua and clear your package cache</p>
    <p>after uninstalling lua please make a github issue so we can look into ways of preventing this common package conflict</p>
    <p>please re-run the program once the package is gone and you have cleared it's cache files.</p>

  <details>
    <summary><span style="color: royalblue;"><u>Clang failed for X reason</u></span></summary>
    <p>if clang fails to compile and read the C, C++ files then please make a github issue that includes the log file</p>
    <p>once you have made a github issue please wait for a response and work with contributors or junior developers as needed</p>
    <p>if your issue is not resolved your issue ticket on github will be marked with P2 Unsolved as it's status</p>
    <p>this means your issue will become a slightly higher priority and we will mark the issue as solved once we resolve the error/bug.</p>

  <details>
    <summary><span style="color: royalblue;"><u>security & risk concerns</u></span></summary>
    <p>if you are concerned about the security of your system while using Nexus and Nexus related tools or products</p>
    <p>then please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/JohnTeBrown/Nexus-Target-Verifier/blob/main/SECURITY.md">SECURITY.md</a> on github</p>
    <p>keep your linux kernel up to date to protect against potential vulnerabilties and exploits</p>
    <p>refrain from running dangerouse scripts or running root level commands via the web console tab in the nexus panel</p>
    <p>refrain from installing or running scripts or root level commands in the container shell "shell.sh"</p>
    <p>the container shell connects directly to the devilbox backend which is the engine that gives Nexus life.</p>
